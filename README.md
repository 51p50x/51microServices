# 51 micro services
hey first, sorry for the name but this was the original that i created in the maven archetype, so everyone would get used to including me :sweat_smile:	

I will make the documentation for almost every part of the project.

The project itself would have an Anime Character service, another service that would validate that Character(I'm currently thinkin in something better) and a notification service that would receive information from the previous services.
